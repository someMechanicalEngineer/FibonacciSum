This code makes use of the matrix exponentiation method for calculating the nth component of the Fibonacci sequence.
The values are calculated using a while loop which stops after the upper limit has been reached. 
Since the while loop will run a cycle too many for most Fibonacci numbers, an if-statement ensures that only values below or including the upper limit are taken into account.
To filter for even numbers, the modulo of 2 is taken. All even values will produce a zero due to the modulo operator and are summed up through this iterative method.

The code can be executed and the result will be displayed in the terminal. 


Enjoy!
